Github local repository connection tutorial:

	//Download git 1.8.4
	//https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/detail?name=Git-1.8.4-preview20130916.exe&can=2&q=

git config --global user.name "John Doe"

git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com"

git config --global core.editor emacs

git config --global merge.tool vimdiff

git remote add origin https://github.com/"group_username"/"repository_name".git
	//don't forget the ".git"!!!!
	//seriously remember the ".git" on the end, it's crucial,

mkdir projects
	
cd projects

mkdir "Group username"

cd "Group username"
	
git init
	//you have to initialize the file from the subset. This is very
	//important. Otherwise github will not recognize your file exists
	//which can stump you for days if you don't realize it. Literally
	//...days

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "johndoe@example.com"
	//it will prompt a statement at you, just press enter
	//create passphrase (won't show what you type but it is recording each letter)
	//need to remember this password

clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	//saves the id you just created to your clip board, you will need
	//to 'control v' in a minute
	//open git hub
	//go to your profile and open the edit your profile tab
	//from there go to the SSH Keys tab on the left under your profile
	//click add SSH Key
	//Control v under the Key portion and then add key
	//	you have the option to save a title, my recommendation is you use 
	//	your password as the name in order to easily remember it.

ssh -T git@github.com

yes
	//At this point it should say something about permanently adding 
	//'github.com192...' (RSA) to your list of known hosts
"password" 
	//this is for entering your previously created passphrase
	//again important to note it will not show you what you are typing but
	//do it anyway then hit enter

	//At this time the code should say Hi "john doe" you've successfully...
	//pay no attention to the "does not provide shell access" that's not
	//important. You uploaded it correctly.

git config --global branch.master.merge refs/heads/master
	//it's supposed to be "git@github.com" don't worry about changing it
	//for something else	

git pull origin master 
	//this should pull the appropriate files to your computer
	
	//You will find your files, saved in my computer, users, "your username", projects, FRC-2014
	//Here also you will find all the files you pulled previously.


	Congragulations you have successfully connected your remote repository to the Github online
